# Action types:
# - "ignore": Skip this operation entirely (won't get any x-speakeasy annotations)
# - "entity": Force operation to map to specific entity (value = entity name)
# - "match": Override parameter mapping (value = "param_name:field_name")

operations:
  # IGNORE: Skip operations that shouldn't be treated as entity operations
  # Contains a parameter we cannot reconcile across entity operations
